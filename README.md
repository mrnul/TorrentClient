# TorrentClient

Attempting to make a torrent client in Python using asyncio

So far...

1) bencoding / decoding is ok

2) Tracker GET requests are ok

3) Connection with peers is established

4) Files are created and written

5) Requests are distributed (in a dummy way) to peers

6) Showing progress and number of connected peers

7) Torrents can be resumed

8) Multiple torrents can be downloaded at the same time

Still more to be done...
